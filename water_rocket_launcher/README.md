# water rocket launcher

STEM children toy.
assembly instructions can be taken from NASA's [Rocket educator guide](https://www.nasa.gov/stem-ed-resources/rockets.html).

this repo has some 3D printer elements, that simplifies assembly a bit.


## TODOs
- consider different release mechanism
- plan pressure valve Mk.III
- open chute when rocket is in the top-most position
