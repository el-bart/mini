# tripod regulation knob

replacement for broken height-lock knob for camera tripod, made by "camrock".
it's core is made of M5x20 screw with a an M5 nut screw in to the very end.
to make sure it holds really tight i've used self-locking nut and a bit of a CA blue on the thread and in between mating surfaces.
