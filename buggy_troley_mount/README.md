# buggy trolley mount

mount for children trolley to a buggy.

1st print out of PLA failed after a couple of months of daily usage.

2nd print is done with 3 more layers of perimeters and top/bottom layers.
print is also done in PET-G, so that it will be able to "survive" in elevated temperatures
(eg. car's interior during a summer time).
