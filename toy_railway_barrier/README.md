# toy railway barrier

![final product](pic/final.jpg)

toy railway barrier, having dual positions (up/.down).
rising and falling is done slowly, for better realism.

position is toggled by a button press.
default is up.

based on arduino nano board.

## wiring

![electronics](pic/electronics.jpg)

![in the box](pic/in_the_box.jpg)

servo shall be connected to pin 2.
+5V can be taken directly from the board.
depending on the board and power supply, you might want/need to solder 100ÂµF decoupling capacitor on the power line.

monostable button shall be connected to pin 3.
it does not matter if button is normally open or closed - sw will handle both.
remember to add ~10k Ohm resistor from pin 3 to power line, so that button's state is stable.

## mechanical

most parts are to be glued with a hot glue gun.

servo get screwed into harness with dual M2x10 screws and nuts.
harness is designed for micro 9g servo.
