navibot's docking station side walls
===

navibot is a cool thing, unfortunately it often hangs itself on a docking station rant, instead of joining it to recharge/empty itself.
these two prints are sidewalls for the docking station, that prohibit robot from entering "hang zone".

print time: ~3:15h (each)
